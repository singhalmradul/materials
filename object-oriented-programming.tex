\section{Introduction}
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Here are the fundamental concepts of OOP:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Classes:} Templates for creating objects, defining their structure and behavior.
    \item \textbf{Objects:} Instances of classes that represent specific elements with attributes and behaviors.
    \item \textbf{Encapsulation:} Hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
    \item \textbf{Abstraction:} Exposing only the necessary and relevant parts of an object to the outside world.
    \item \textbf{Inheritance:} A mechanism for one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class.
    \item \textbf{Polymorphism:} The ability to present the same interface for differing underlying data types.
\end{itemize}
\newpage

\section{Association, Aggregation \& Composition}
\subsection{Association}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When an object have a relationship with another object
    \item \textbf{Example:}
          \begin{lstlisting}
class Foo {
    private Bar bar;
};
          \end{lstlisting}
          \lstinline|Foo| uses \lstinline|Bar|
    \item It may be \textit{one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one} or \textit{many-to-many} relationship
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Aggregation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  A relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent.
    \item \textbf{Example:}
          \begin{lstlisting}
class Foo {
    private Bar bar;
    Foo(Bar bar) {
       this.bar = bar;
    }
}
          \end{lstlisting}
          When \lstinline|Foo| dies, \lstinline|Bar| may live on
          \item It may be \textit{one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one} or \textit{many-to-many} relationship
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Composition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item An object owns another object and is responsible for that object's lifetime.
    \item \textbf{Example:}
          \begin{lstlisting}
class Foo {
    private Bar bar = new Bar();
}
          \end{lstlisting}
          When \lstinline|Foo| dies, so does \lstinline|Bar|
          \item It may be \textit{one-to-one} or \textit{one-to-many} relationship

% \section*{Abstract}

% \textbf{HiV}, or \textbf{high-five}, stands out in the social media landscape with its ethos of mindful engagement. This abstract delves into the platform's unique approach to social networking, which emphasizes intentional interaction over passive consumption.

% Central to HiV is its dedication to reshaping the digital experience by prioritizing effective time management. The platform counters the relentless stream of content with features that encourage users to engage with a sense of purpose and awareness.

% The narrative of HiV begins with its commitment to mindfulness in the digital space, inviting users to engage actively with content that resonates with their interests. This focus on mindfulness represents a significant shift in the value derived from online interactions.

% Time management is a key aspect of HiV, addressing the common issue of digital distraction. The platform offers tools like the ``digital detox timer'' to help users navigate their online presence more meaningfully.\\
% Examining these features reveals HiV's innovative strategies to enhance user experience. By setting personal screen time goals, users are encouraged to consider the quality of their digital engagements, leading to more intentional and fulfilling interactions.

% In conclusion, this abstract introduces HiV as more than a social media platform; it's a catalyst for change in the digital world. It champions intentional engagement, mindfulness, and authentic relationships, signaling a shift towards a more meaningful social media experience.

% \section{Implementation Challenges and Solutions}
% \subsection{Lack of Like/Unlike Icon Animation}
% \subsubsection*{Challenge}
% There is no animation for like/unlike icon when the user clicks the like button.
% \subsubsection*{Solution}
% \begin{itemize}
%       \item use React Component State for providing the animation-like look and feel.
%       \item like-icon.tsx
%             \begin{lstlisting}
%       import { ReactComponent as Like0 } from '../../assets/like/0.svg';
%       import { ReactComponent as Like1 } from '../../assets/like/1.svg';
%             (*@$\vdots$@*)
%       import { ReactComponent as Like21 } from '../../assets/like/21.svg';
%       import { ReactComponent as Like22 } from '../../assets/like/22.svg';
%       import { MouseEventHandler, useEffect, useState } from 'react';


%       const svgs = [
%             Like0,
%             Like1,
%             (*@$\vdots$@*)
%             Like21,
%             Like22,
%       ];
%       type LikeIconProps = {
%       isLiked: boolean;
%       onClick: MouseEventHandler<SVGElement>;
%       };

%       const LikeIcon = ({ isLiked, onClick }: LikeIconProps) => {
%       const [phase, setPhase] = useState(isLiked ? svgs.length - 1 : 0);

%       useEffect(() => {
%       if (isLiked && phase < svgs.length - 1) {
%             setPhase(phase + 1);
%       }
%       if (!isLiked && phase > 0) {
%             setPhase(phase - 1);
%       }
%       }, [isLiked, phase]);

%       const Icon = svgs[phase];
%       return <Icon onClick={onClick} />;
%       };

%       export default LikeIcon;

%       \end{lstlisting}

% \subsection{Lack of Authorities that allow mutable username and email}
% \subsubsection*{Challenge}
% The authorisation services do not provide a way to update the username and email fields.
% \subsubsection*{Solution}
% \begin{itemize}
%       \item Implemented the authorisation service using Spring Authorization Server.
%       \item Created custom authorities that allow mutable username and email fields.
%       \item Updated the user service to handle username and email updates.
% \end{itemize}
% \subsection{Mutating User Account Data}
% \subsubsection*{Challenge}
% The user account data was being mutated directly by the authorisation server.
% \subsubsection*{Solution}
% \begin{itemize}
%       \item Use a shared database instance between the authorisation server and user service.
%       \item Use the user service to manage user data.
%       \item Use the user service to update user profile data in the shared database.
%       \item Snippet from SharedDatabaseConfiguration.java
%             \begin{lstlisting}

% }
%             \end{lstlisting}
% \end{itemize}
% \subsection{Expose Password Hashes to the User Service}
% \subsubsection*{Challenge}
% The authorisation server does not expose password hashes to the user service for user authentication.
% \subsubsection*{Solution}
% \begin{itemize}
%       \item Storing password hashes in a separate database instance, that is only accessible to the authorisation server.
%       \item Snippet from UserDatabaseConfiguration.java
%             \begin{lstlisting}

% \subsection{Inconsistent User Profile Data}
% \subsubsection*{Challenge}
% The user profile data was inconsistent across microservices, with different data stored in different databases.
% \subsubsection*{Solution}
% \begin{itemize}
%       \item Checking the user profile data consistency across microservices.
%       \item Snippet from UserServiceImpl.java
%             \begin{lstlisting}

% \subsection{Casting User into its Projections}
% \subsubsection*{Challenge}
% Casting User into its projections was not possible due to Incompatible types.
% \subsubsection*{Solution}
% \begin{itemize}
%       \item Using Generics and Runtime Class Loading to cast User into its projections.
%       \item Snippet from UserServiceImpl.java
%             \begin{lstlisting}

% \subsection{Inconsistent Post Feed}
% \subsubsection*{Challenge}
% The post feed is inconsistent, with posts from followed users not showing up in the feed.
% \subsubsection*{Solution}
% \begin{itemize}
%       \item Use a graph database to store follow relationships between users.
%       \item Use a query to retrieve posts from followed users and display them in the feed.
%       \item Use a caching mechanism to store posts from followed users and update the feed with new posts.
%       \item Use a background job to fetch posts from followed users and update the feed periodically.
